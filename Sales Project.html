                    <h3>Project Summary</h3>
                    <p>The "Sales and Ranking Dashboard" project is a sophisticated Power BI visual analytics tool designed to streamline the sales monitoring process for business decision-makers. The dashboard provides a multi-faceted view of sales performance metrics, including revenue, orders, and average transaction price (ATP). With a focus on key performance indicators, the dashboard showcases revenue by product group and sales channel, orders by product category, and a detailed ranking of salespersons based on revenue generated. It offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface, where data can be filtered by year to track performance over time. This powerful tool is engineered to aid in identifying top-performing products and salespeople, as well as to highlight areas for potential growth.</p>

                    <h3>Insights</h3>
                    <p><b>Sales Performace:</b> The dashboard reveals that specific product groups, such as Wheat Flour and Oil, contribute significantly to the overall revenue, indicating a strong market position or demand for these items.
                        The distribution of sales by channel highlights a heavy reliance on distributor and online sales, suggesting a robust B2B market presence and the importance of e-commerce strategies.<br>
                        <b>Salesperson Ranking:</b> The top performers in terms of revenue and orders are prominently displayed, with Carla Ferreira leading the pack. This not only recognizes high achievers but also sets a benchmark for other team members.<br>
                        <b>Trends and Opportunities:</b> A comparison of revenue against the budget over consecutive quarters provides insight into business health and financial planning effectiveness.
                        The ATP metric offers a granular view of profitability per transaction, which can be used to refine sales strategies.<br>                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>This Power BI project not only sheds light on the current energy efficiency ratings of domestic properties in Aberdeen and Edinburgh but also highlights the crucial areas where efforts must be concentrated. By addressing the identified limitations and continuously updating the data, stakeholders can better track progress and adapt strategies to meet energy performance targets effectively.</p>
