                    <h3>Project Summary</h3>
                    <p>The Patients Emergency Room Visit Report offers a comprehensive Power BI dashboard that presents critical data on patient visits to emergency departments. The report encapsulates a wealth of information such as visit totals, breakdowns by administrative and non-administrative appointments, patient demographics, satisfaction ratings, wait times, and referral patterns. The dashboard visualizes data trends across various dimensions including time (by month and year), patient age groups, and the gender distribution of visitors. With interactive selectors for time of day and average wait times, the tool provides healthcare administrators with actionable insights to optimize ER operations and patient care.</p>

                    <p>Power BI <br>DAX <br>Flaticon <br></p>
                    <h3>Insights</h3>
                    <p><b>Visit Patterns:</b> The majority of ER visits occur during weekdays, with adults constituting the largest age group, suggesting that resources should be allocated accordingly to manage peak times.
                        A significant proportion of patients are walk-ins, highlighting the importance of efficient triage systems to manage unscheduled visits.<br>
                        <b>Service Utilization:</b> The dashboard indicates that the majority of referrals come from General Practice and Orthopedics, which could guide collaborations and resource sharing with these departments.
                        The visualization of patient flow by month can assist in predicting high-volume periods and preparing for fluctuating demands.<br>
                        <b>Trends and Opportunities:</b> Average satisfaction scores and wait times are prominently displayed, providing immediate feedback on patient experience and operational efficiency.
                        The distribution of patient race and wait times can serve as a baseline for addressing disparities in care and wait times experienced by different demographic groups.<br>                    
                        
                    <h3>Recommendation</h3>
                    <p><b>Resource Management</b>

                            <li>Allocate additional staff and resources during peak weekday hours and bolster support for adult care, which is the largest patient group.</li>
                            <li>Develop strategies to streamline the process for walk-in patients to reduce wait times and improve satisfaction.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <b>Collaborative Care</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Strengthen communication and referral processes with General Practice and Orthopedics to manage patient flows more effectively.</li>
                            <li>Implement a feedback mechanism to regularly assess and address the specific needs of referred patients.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <b>Patient-Centered Improvements</b>

                            <li>Use satisfaction and wait time data to implement targeted improvements in patient care processes.</li>
                            <li>Conduct further analysis on demographic disparities to ensure equitable care across all patient groups.</li>
