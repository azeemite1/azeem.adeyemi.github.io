                    <h3>Project Summary</h3>
                    <p>The "Domestic Housing Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) Analysis" project leverages Power BI's dynamic visualization capabilities to scrutinize the energy efficiency of domestic properties in Aberdeen and Edinburgh. The project concentrates on three primary objectives: evaluating the number of properties currently rated below band C in terms of energy efficiency, identifying properties that need to move above band B by 2023, and assessing the prevalence of main gas heating among the properties. Through a series of interactive dashboards, the project offers stakeholders a detailed overview of the current energy performance landscape, providing actionable insights that can inform policy decisions and strategic initiatives aimed at improving energy efficiency in residential buildings.</p>
                    <h3>Tools</h3>
                    <p>Power BI <br>DAX <br>Flaticon <br></p>
                    <h3>Insights</h3>
                    <p><b>Properties Below Band C:</b> A significant number of properties remain below the desired EPC band C, with a concentrated effort required to elevate the energy performance. Aberdeen and Edinburgh show varying distributions, indicating a potential need for location-specific intervention strategies.<br>
                        <b>Progression to Band B:</b> The trend analysis suggests that while some properties are on the cusp of achieving band B status by 2023, a substantial push in terms of energy conservation measures is required. This indicates an opportunity for targeted retrofitting and energy-saving initiatives.<br>
                        <b>Main Gas Heating Utilization:</b> A high prevalence of main gas heating is observed among the properties, suggesting a dependency on conventional heating methods. This opens up a dialogue about the potential for transition to renewable energy sources to improve the EPC ratings.<br>
                    <h3>Limitations</h3>
                    <p><b>Data Granularity:</b> While the provided data enables a broad assessment, there may be limitations regarding the granularity of information available for individual properties. Deeper insights might require more detailed data, including age, exact location, and historical energy consumption patterns.<br>
                        <b>Geographic Scope:</b> As with any historical analysis, the accuracy and consistency of data can vary and may present challenges.</p>
                    <h3>Data Source</h3>
                    <p>The data utilized for this analysis was sourced from the comprehensive database available at <a href="https://statistics.gov.scot/data/domestic-energy-performance-certificates"><b>Statistics Gov Scotland</b></a>, which provides a wealth of information on domestic energy performance across Scotland. This reliable and government-maintained database ensures the integrity and credibility of the analysis.</p>
                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>This Power BI project not only sheds light on the current energy efficiency ratings of domestic properties in Aberdeen and Edinburgh but also highlights the crucial areas where efforts must be concentrated. By addressing the identified limitations and continuously updating the data, stakeholders can better track progress and adapt strategies to meet energy performance targets effectively.</p>
                    <h3>Recommendation</h3>
                    <p><b>Energy Efficiency Improvements:</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Implement targeted retrofit programs focusing on insulation, double glazing, and efficient heating systems, especially for properties rated D and below.</li>
                            <li>Offer incentives for property owners in Aberdeen and Edinburgh to undertake energy efficiency improvements, such as tax rebates or grants.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <b>Renewable Energy Transition:</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Encourage the adoption of renewable energy sources by providing subsidies for the installation of solar panels and heat pumps, reducing the reliance on main gas heating.</li>
                            <li>Develop community projects to raise awareness and increase the uptake of renewable energy technologies in residential areas.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <b>Policy and Regulation:</b>

                            <li>Consider revising building codes to require higher EPC ratings for new constructions and major renovations.</li>
                            <li>Work with energy companies to offer discounted rates for energy audits and to support energy efficiency upgrades.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <b>Data-Driven Approach:</b>
